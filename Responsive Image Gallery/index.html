              Heliconia is a genus of flowering plants in the monotypic family
              Heliconiaceae. Most of the 194 known species are native to the
              tropical Americas, but a few are indigenous to certain islands of
              the western Pacific and Maluku in Indonesia. Many species of
              Heliconia are found in the tropical forests of these regions.

              A hill is a landform that extends above the surrounding terrain.
              It often has a distinct summit, and is usually applied to peaks
              which are above elevation compared to the relative landmass,
              though not as prominent as mountains.

              Green Mountain is a common name for "The Peak", the highest point
              and a stratovolcano on Ascension Island, which has gained some
              fame for claims that it is one of very few large-scale artificial
              forests. Green Mountain is ranked 38th by topographic isolation.

              A summit is a point on a surface that is higher in elevation than
              all points immediately adjacent to it. The topographic terms acme,
              apex, peak (mountain peak), and zenith are synonymous. The term
              top (mountain top) is generally used only for a mountain peak that
              is located at some distance from the nearest point of higher
              elevation.

              railway track (British English and UIC terminology) or railroad track (American English), also known as a train track or permanent way (often "perway"[1] in Australia), is the structure on a railway or railroad consisting of the rails, fasteners, railroad ties (sleepers, British English) and ballast (or slab track), plus the underlying subgrade. It enables trains to move by providing a dependable surface for their wheels to roll upon.

              mountain pass is a navigable route through a mountain range or over a ridge. Since mountain ranges can present formidable barriers to travel, passes have played a key role in trade, war, and both human and animal migration throughout history. At lower elevations it may be called a hill pass.

              A sea is a large body of salty water. There are particular seas and the sea. The sea commonly refers to the ocean, the wider body of seawater. Particular seas are either marginal seas, second-order sections of the oceanic sea (e.g. the Mediterranean Sea), or certain large, nearly landlocked bodies of water.

              tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, usually supporting branches and leaves. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. In wider definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees.
